# Poke Systems

This is one of the first games I ever created back when I was a high school freshman. 
This was made as a final project for a Biology class, in where we had to make something that explains different systems of anatomy that we learned about in our final chapter. Me and my friend had the idea of creating a pokemon style game in where you explore a human body, with pokemon being different types of cells that you find in different parts. The actual game design, art, and mechanics leave alot to be desired as we were on a 2 week deadline and my knowledge of good programming was limited, but we finished.

While many aspects of the codebase make me cringe, like the fact that I wrote this entirely using java.swing, it still stands as a stepping stone in understanding how games are made from the ground up. Even if some parts were overcomplicated, I am still proud of what I achieved as a freshman such as the custom map formats that could be easily loaded in, an ingame console, and the creation of tooling for my partner so he did not need to write any code to develop the pokemon or maps. 

The project has been left mostly untouched since I finished it in early 2020, with the exception of constraining the frame rate to 60 fps as it made running the game unbearable on some platforms I tried it on (eg. on my laptop it would try running as fast as possible and lag everything else to a significant degree). 

## Running the program
To run this you will need to open the project in the [PokeSystems](PokeSystems) directory in Netbeans or IntelIJ

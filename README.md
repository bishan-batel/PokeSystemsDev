# Poke Systems

This is one of the first games I ever created back when I was a high school freshman. 
This was made as a final project for a Biology class, in where we had to make something that explains different systems of anatomy that we learned about in our final chapter. Me and my friend had the idea of creating a pokemon style game in where you explore a human body, with pokemon being different types of cells that you find in different parts. The actual game design, art, and mechanics leave alot to be desired as we were on a 2 week deadline and my knowledge of good programming was limited, but we finished.

While many aspects of the codebase make me cringe, like the fact that I wrote this entirely using java.swing, it still stands as a stepping stone in understanding how games are made from the ground up.

## Running the program
To run this you will need to open the project in the [PokeSystems](PokeSystems) directory in Netbeans or IntelIJ
